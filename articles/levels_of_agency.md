| **✩✩✩✩ <br>Simple Processor**                                | The model has no impact on the program’s flow.                                                                                    | `print(llm_output(llm_response))`                                                                                                                 | The human remains fully in control; the model is just a tool that processes and returns information without affecting decision-making.                         |
| **★✩✩✩ <br> Router (Basic Program Flow Decision)**            | The model influences which path the program takes based on its decision.                                                          | `if llm_decision():`<br>`    path_a()`<br>`else:`<br>`    path_b()`                                                                               | **Human:** Designs the available functions and overall structure.<br>**System:** Decides when and which path to take based on the model's decision.         |
| **★★✩✩ <br>Tool (Determines How Functions Are Executed)**     | The model selects not just the path but also specifics about function execution.                                                  | `call_run_function(llm_chosen_tool, llm_chosen_args)`                                                                                           | **Human:** Specifies what functions should be executed.<br>**System:** Decides how they are executed by choosing appropriate tools and arguments.             |
| **★★★✩ <br> Multi-Step Agent (Controls Iteration and Continuation)** | The model governs the flow over multiple steps, including when to continue iterating through tasks.                                 | `while should_continue():`<br>`    execute_next_step()`                                                                                          | **Human:** Determines what functions exist (i.e., the available operations).<br>**System:** Chooses which function to run, when, and how—thus controlling the iterative process. |
| **★★★★ <br> Fully Autonomous Agent (Creates & Executes New Code)** | At this highest level, the model doesn’t just select among pre-defined functions; it creates new code and executes it based on the user’s request. | `create_code(user_request)`<br>`execute()`                                                                                                       | **System:** Has full control. The model is entirely autonomous and responsible for both generating and executing code.                                           |
